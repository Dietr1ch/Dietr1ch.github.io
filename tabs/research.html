		<h1>Research</h1>
		<p>I got to do a little research while on my Masters before I joined the industry.</p>
		<p>I'd love to come back to this someday.</p>

		<h2>Linked Data</h2>
		<p>In Linked Data navigational queries are expensive to compute as it requries navigating the graph across many possibly possibly servers.</p>
		<p>We found a way to use the query itself to derive a consistent heuristic that makes A* available for computing Property Paths more effectively than uninformed Search Algorithms, which helps reducing the amount of nodes expanded to get the answers to a given query.</p>

		<h2>Hierarchic Heuristic Search</h2>
		<p>I'm experimenting with a way to abstract search spaces into a hierarchic space that can provide subgoals and better heuristics.</p>
